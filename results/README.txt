Following Justin's script, added detector_date to 2012 pass_bin, then summed by night.

Following Justin's script, joined pass_bin_nightly_sum + detector_date_to_site + site_to_variables for 2011 & 2012.
named these files: 
pass_bin_2011_nightly_sums_full
pass_bin_2012_nightly_sums_full
respectively

checked corrections Justin made to temperature script, converted temperature data with right date/time to csv, to check visually.

Then tried to loop through date columns and extract mean, max, min, and sunset temperature- but ran into error (I think because the temperature column values have decimals), pushed script to Justin for help.
