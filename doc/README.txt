Made preliminary graphs of total average nightly activity by site, dominant species activity in pair vs. not pair, and total species prevalence using the 2011 & 2012 data combined.

On tab 4 (average passes by site) calculated the percent of total activity that occurred at top 4 sites = 37%, then calculated relative activity at pair/not pair within those sites and averaged between those sites. Used this calculation in the Wildlife society abstract as argument for increased activity in proximity to natural habitat. (can't argue small vineyard b/c 2nd highest was at COHOP- very large vineyard).
